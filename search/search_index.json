Let's see how it develops in the future. </p> <p>But first, I want to announce the a minor update of RST-Tace:</p> <p>RST-Tace is a tool in the wider field of natural language processing and analysis \u2014 more specifically, in the field of Rhetorical Structure Theory. It was created during a research project by ShujunW and published at the Discourse Relation Parsing and Treebanking (DISRPT) workshop of the NAACL conference in Minneapolis in 2019.</p> <p>Now, six years old and initially developed and tested with Python 3.6, it was in need of a small update. Pandas was updated to version 2.x in the meantime, which introduced some changes in how dataframes are handled.</p> <p>While the initially published version 0.1.0 of RST-Tace still works perfectly fine when using the CLI as the output interface, the CSV output threw an error:</p> <p>The functionality of outputting a CSV when comparing two sets of multiple RST trees relied on the now-deprecated <code>dataframe.append()</code> function.</p> <p>With version 0.1.1 (tested with Pyhon 3.13.2), this issue has now been fixed.</p> <p>If you found another issues or if you have a feature request for RST-Tace, feel free to add an issue.</p> <p>Thank you very much! ~</p>"},{"location":"archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
